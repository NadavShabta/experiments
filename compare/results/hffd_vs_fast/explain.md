# hffd_fast: Improvements over the original hffd
## A Highly Optimized, Vectorized Implementation

`hffd_fast` represents a significant leap in performance for the HFFD algorithm for chore allocation, achieved through extensive optimization and vectorization. Compared to the original `hffd`, the following key improvements and changes were made:

### 1. Full Vectorization:
* All cost and feasibility checks are performed using **NumPy arrays** and **boolean masks**, effectively eliminating slow Python loops and generator expressions.
* Bundle construction and agent selection are handled with highly **efficient NumPy operations**, leveraging its optimized C implementations.

### 2. Efficient Bundle Construction:
* For each item being considered for a bundle, feasibility checks across **all agents are performed in parallel** using NumPy's broadcasting capabilities. This replaces the much slower process of looping over agents and items individually in pure Python.

### 3. Fast Agent Selection:
* Identifying the first feasible agent for a constructed bundle is now accomplished using **vectorized NumPy operations**, completely avoiding the need for repeated `sum()` and `any()` calls within Python loops that characterized the original implementation.

### 4. Bundle Shrinking (New Optimization):
* A crucial addition: If no agent can accept the initially formed full bundle, the bundle is **efficiently shrunk** (i.e., items are removed) using optimized array slicing and vectorized checks, rather than iterative Python removal.

### 5. Minimal Python Overhead:
* The design ensures that all computationally intensive "hot-path" logic is executed directly within **NumPy**, where performance is maximized. Only the high-level control flow and orchestration remain in Python, minimizing interpretation overhead.

As a direct consequence of these comprehensive optimizations, `hffd_fast` is **significantly faster** than the original `hffd`, especially when dealing with large problem instances where the performance bottlenecks of the original algorithm become pronounced.
