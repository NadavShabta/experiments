# Analysis of Algorithm Runtime Differences: `hffd` vs. `hffd_nadav`


### Differences in Implementation and Their Impact on Runtime:

* **`hffd` (The Slower Algorithm):**
    * **Bundle-Based Allocation:** This implementation attempts to build "bundles" of chores for each agent iteratively.
    * **High Computational Overhead with Repeated Summations:**
        * At its core, within a `while` loop (roughly for each agent), there's a `for i in order` loop (for each item).
        * Critically, inside this, it performs a check: `if any(sum(cost[(a, j)] for j in bundle) + cost[(a, i)] <= tau[a] for a in agents_left):`
        * The `sum(cost[(a, j)] for j in bundle)` part is a major performance bottleneck. For each item considered for a bundle, this sum iterates over all items *already accumulated in that growing bundle*. If a bundle has `K` items, this sum takes `O(K)` time.
        * Because this sum can be executed multiple times (for each remaining agent) for each item being evaluated, and `K` can grow up to the total number of items (`N`), the overall complexity can approach **`O(M * N^2)` or even higher** in the worst case (where `M` is the number of agents and `N` is the number of items).
    * **Overall Complexity:** The nested loops combined with these repeated, growing summations result in a **super-linear (e.g., quadratic) time complexity** with respect to the number of items. This explains its steep, rapidly rising runtime curve observed in the graph.

* **`hffd_nadav` (The Faster Algorithm):**
    * **Item-by-Item Allocation:** This implementation adopts a much simpler and more direct approach, allocating chores one item at a time.
    * **Efficient Constant-Time Inner Operations:**
        * It uses a straightforward nested loop structure: `for i in order: for a in agents:`.
        * Inside the innermost part, it executes: `if cost[(a, i)] <= tau[a]: builder.give(a, i); tau[a] -= cost[(a, i)]; break`.
        * Each of these individual operations (cost lookup, comparison, subtraction, assignment, and breaking the inner loop) takes effectively **constant time (O(1))**.
    * **Overall Complexity:** The outer loop runs `O(N)` times (for each item), and the inner loop runs up to `O(M)` times (for each agent) but importantly, it often `break`s much earlier. This leads to an **overall time complexity of approximately `O(N * M)`**. This linear growth with respect to the total problem size (`agents × items`) perfectly aligns with the almost flat, very low runtime shown on your graph.

### Conclusion: Why the Huge Runtime Difference Makes Sense

* **Fundamental Algorithmic Complexity Gap:** The "huge difference" in runtime is not an anomaly but a direct consequence of a fundamental difference in their underlying computational complexity. One algorithm scales **quadratically (or worse)** with problem size, while the other scales **linearly**.
* **Impact of Scaling:** As the problem size (number of agents × number of items) increases, an algorithm with `O(N * M)` complexity will perform orders of magnitude better than one with `O(M * N^2)` or higher. For instance, doubling the number of items might roughly double the runtime for `O(N * M)`, but it could quadruple or more the runtime for `O(M * N^2)`.
* **Practical vs. Theoretical Implementation:** While both might conceptually be based on the same higher-level algorithm (`HFFD`), the specific choices made in their low-level implementation regarding how bundles are formed and costs are checked lead to drastically different practical performance. `hffd_nadav` is a significantly more optimized and efficient translation of the core idea into executable code.
* **Observed Behavior Matches Theory:** The provided `runtime_vs_size.png` graph clearly illustrates this theoretical difference. `hffd_nadav` maintains a consistently fast and nearly flat runtime (characteristic of linear complexity), whereas `hffd` shows a sharp, steep increase, which is typical of a much higher polynomial complexity. The "timeout" line further underscores the practical limitations imposed by the less efficient implementation.
